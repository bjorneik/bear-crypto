## The Clock Analogy

When someone asks "What time is it 15 hours after 10 o'clock?", you don't answer "25 o'clock" - you say "1 o'clock." You've just done modular arithmetic! The clock "wraps around" after 12, and this wrapping behavior is fundamental to modern cryptography.

## Formal Definition

In mathematics, we write $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ and say "$a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$" when...
