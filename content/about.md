## About This Blog

Welcome to Bearing Cryptography! This blog documents my exploration of cryptography and its mathematical foundations as a cybersecurity student specializing in cryptographic systems.

The name "Bearing Cryptography" reflects my goal of *bearing* knowledge about cryptography through clear explanations and rigorous examples. (It also connects to my name, Bjørn, which means "bear" in Norwegian!)

## About Me

I'm Bjørn, a computer science student in Norway specializing in cybersecurity with a focus on cryptography. I'm particularly drawn to the mathematical aspects of cryptographic systems and post-quantum cryptography.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Mathematical foundations** essential for understanding cryptography
- **Classical and modern cryptographic systems** explained with worked examples
- **Post-quantum cryptography** as I explore this cutting-edge field
- Detailed explanations with mathematical rigor and practical examples

Each post aims to make complex cryptographic concepts accessible while maintaining technical accuracy.
