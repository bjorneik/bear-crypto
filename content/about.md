## About This Blog

Welcome to Bearing Cryptography! This blog documents my exploration of cryptography and its mathematical foundations as a cybersecurity student.

The name "Bearing Cryptography" reflects my goal of *bearing* knowledge about cryptography. (It also connects to my name, Bjørn, which means "bear" in Norwegian!). My goal is to convey information in a wat that is accessible to as many people as possible. It won't be as rich as a book, but hopefully enough to give a good understanding of the material.

## About Me

I'm Bjørn Eik, a computer science student in Norway specializing in cybersecurity. I hold a master degree in Chemistry, where I specialized in Computational Chemistry. I also worked for three years as a PhD candidate in Computational Chemistry, but I decided to not defend. I've always been drawn to mathematics ever since middle school, and when I took the course Introduction to Cryptography (cheers to Professor Marta Panizzut!) it became very clear to me that being a cryptographer would be the best for me.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Mathematical foundations** essential for understanding cryptography
- **Classical and modern cryptographic systems** explained with worked examples
- **Post-quantum cryptography** as I explore this cutting-edge field
- Detailed explanations with mathematical rigor and practical examples
