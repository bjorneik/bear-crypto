## About This Blog

Welcome to Bearing Cryptography! This blog documents my exploration of cryptography and its mathematical foundations as a cybersecurity student at UiT The Arctic University of Norway.

The name "Bearing Cryptography" reflects my goal of *bearing* knowledge about cryptography through clear explanations and rigorous examples. It also connects to my name, Bjørn, which means "bear" in Norwegian! My goal is to make cryptographic concepts accessible without sacrificing mathematical accuracy—not as comprehensive as a textbook, but thorough enough to build genuine understanding.

## About Me

I'm Bjørn Eik, a computer science student in Tromsø, Norway, specializing in cybersecurity. 

Before switching to computer science, I completed a master's degree in Chemistry with a specialization in Computational Chemistry, and worked for three years as a PhD candidate in the same field. Although I ultimately chose not to defend my dissertation, those years strengthened my mathematical foundation and analytical approach to problem-solving.

I've been drawn to mathematics since middle school, but it was the courses Discrete Mathematics and Introduction to Cryptography (shout out to Professors Glen Wilson and Marta Panizzut) that crystallized my path: becoming a cryptographer combines my love for mathematics with practical applications in security.
